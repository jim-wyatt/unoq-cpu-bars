# WHY THE BOARD CARRIES THESE
# ---------------------------
# The board is the thing you plug into a laptop that may have no internet, or a
# locked-down one. Microsoft's `update.code.visualstudio.com/latest/...` aliases
# always resolve to the current stable build, so this stays current without
# pinning a version that goes stale in the repo.
#
# These are Microsoft's binaries under their own licence - they are downloaded
# onto your board, never redistributed by this project. See THIRD-PARTY.md.
