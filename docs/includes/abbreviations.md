Appended to every page by pymdownx.snippets (see mkdocs.yml). Any of these
acronyms appearing anywhere in the site gets a dotted underline and a hover
definition, without the author having to mark it up.

Keep the definitions to one line. If a term needs a paragraph it belongs in
docs/glossary.md, and most of these are in both.

This file is NOT in the nav and renders as nothing on its own.
