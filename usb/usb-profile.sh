# Work out which kind of computer is on the other end of the USB cable, and take
# an address on its terms when it will not lease us one. Called by usb-dhcp.sh
# on leasefail, not by you - except `detect`, which changes nothing.
#
#   usb/usb-profile.sh detect            # name the host on the other end
#   usb/usb-profile.sh up <profile>      # claim its address, keep it only if it routes
#   usb/usb-profile.sh down <profile>    # give the address back
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# A lease is still the right answer and still wins outright. This is for the
# case the lease path cannot cover, which is not hypothetical - it is the board
# this was written on:
#
#   the host answers ARP at 192.168.137.1        it is there
#   it forwards and NATs to the internet         ping and TCP both out, ~17ms
#   it answers no DHCP discover at all           three tries, nothing
#
# That is Windows Internet Connection Sharing with its NAT half working and its
# DHCP half not - most often the firewall profile on that adapter dropping
# inbound DHCP. Everything the board needs is on the other end of the cable and
# reachable; the only missing thing is somebody to hand over an address. So the
# board takes one.
#
# WHY PROFILES RATHER THAN ONE HARDCODED SUBNET
# ---------------------------------------------
# Because "which computer is this plugged into" is genuinely a variable, and it
# is the ONLY thing that varies. There is one wire, one gadget function, one
# netdev and one bridge - gadget-up.sh builds a single configuration on purpose,
# and usb-net-up.sh explains why br-usb survives as a name rather than as a
# bridge. What differs between a PC and a Mac is not the link, it is the
# numbering on it: ICS pins 192.168.137.1/24, macOS Internet Sharing 192.168.2.1,
# a Linux host whatever its dnsmasq was told.
#
# So the thing there are several of is the ADDRESS PROFILE, and exactly one of
# them is ever active. That is not a style preference: avahi advertises every
# address an interface has, so two live profiles would mean two A records for
# <hostname>.local and a host free to pick the one it cannot route to. That is
# the exact failure the old static 10.55.0.1 caused, and the reason this whole
# design has one address on this bridge. See usb-dhcp.sh.
#
# HOW A PROFILE IS CHOSEN
# -----------------------
# By asking the wire, not by guessing from a config file. Each profile names the
# address its kind of host puts on its own shared adapter, and detection is an
# ARP request for it: a reply means that host is on the other end, silence means
# it is not. ARP because it is answered by the network stack itself - ICMP is
# not, since Windows firewalls ping to the ICS adapter by default, and a check
# that used ping would report "no host" for the most common host there is.
#
# NOTHING IS CLAIMED WITHOUT PROOF
# --------------------------------
# Two proofs, both required, because an address claimed wrongly is worse than no
# address:
#
#   1. the address is free   RFC 5227 ARP probe (arping -D) before taking it, so
#                            the board never collides with a host, or with
#                            another board on a machine running two of them.
#   2. the route works       an actual packet to the internet through the bridge
#                            after the route is in. A profile that matches but
#                            does not forward is torn straight back down and the
#                            caller falls back to link-local, which at least
#                            reaches the one computer.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
# ----------------------------------
# It does not guess. If no profile's gateway answers, this reports nothing and
# link-local takes over - it will not sweep the subnet, invent numbering, or
# claim an address on a network it has not identified. A Linux host with its own
# numbering is a line in the config file below, not something to be divined.
#
# It does not touch avahi-autoipd. usb-dhcp.sh owns the one-address rule and
# stops link-local before calling `up`, because that rule has to be enforced in
# one place to be enforceable at all.
