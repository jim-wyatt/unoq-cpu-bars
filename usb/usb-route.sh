# Default route out through whichever computer is on the other end of the USB
# cable. Called by usb-dhcp.sh on a lease event, not by you.
#
#   usb/usb-route.sh <add|old|del|prefer> <gateway-ip>
#
# WHY A LEASE HOOK
# ----------------
# The host's gateway address is not knowable in advance. Windows ICS uses
# 192.168.137.1, macOS Internet Sharing 192.168.2.1, a Linux host whatever it
# was configured with - and which computer is on the other end of the cable can
# change between one plug-in and the next. The lease is the only moment that
# address is authoritative, so the route is set from there rather than polled
# for or hardcoded.
#
# It took a <mac> second argument until recently, because it was a dnsmasq
# --dhcp-script back when the board could also be the DHCP server on this link.
# It has one caller now.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
# ---------------------
# It does not make the internet work by itself. It points the board's default
# route at the host; the host still has to be routing and NAT-ing for packets
# to go anywhere. On Windows that is Internet Connection Sharing, or
# New-NetNat from an elevated PowerShell. Without it you get a route and
# silence, which is why the metric below matters.
#
# THE METRIC
# ----------
# 700, chosen to lose to everything NetworkManager installs for a real link.
# The intent has always been that this route is a fallback of last resort: if
# the board has any genuine route to the internet, that keeps winning and this
# one sits unused. Only when the USB cable is the board's sole link should it
# take over. A USB gadget that silently stole the default route from a working
# network would be a nasty thing to debug.
#
# This was 500, which did not achieve that, and the reasoning is worth keeping
# because it is an easy mistake to repeat. NetworkManager does not give every
# connection the ~100 you see on ethernet - the default metric is per device
# type, and for wifi it is 600:
#
#   default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 proto dhcp src 192.168.0.172 metric 600
#
# So on a board whose only uplink is wifi - which is the normal case for this
# one, and the configuration you are most likely to be developing over - 500
# beat the real connection instead of losing to it. Plugging the board into a
# computer would hand it the default route. SSH survived (that is a connected
# route on the LAN, not the default), so it looked fine, while every outbound
# connection went to a host that was almost certainly not NAT-ing: apt, git and
# anything else needing the internet simply stopped, with no error pointing
# anywhere near USB.
#
# Higher metric = lower priority, so 700 loses to wifi's 600 and to ethernet's
# 100, while still beating the 1024 the kernel hands an unconfigured route. If
# you would rather it never touched the default route at all, the escape hatch
# is UNOQ_USB_DEFAULT_ROUTE=0.
#
# AND THE OTHER METRIC, 550
# -------------------------
# `prefer` is the answer to "I plugged the cable in, why am I still on wifi".
# 700 means the USB link never carries traffic while the radio is on, so the
# only way to use the cable was to turn wifi off by hand. 550 beats wifi's 600
# and still loses to ethernet's 100, so the cable wins as soon as it is in.
#
# What makes that safe is that it is NOT what a lease installs. The bug this
# file documents above - metric 500 handing the default route to a machine that
# was not NAT-ing - was not caused by the number being low. It was caused by the
# number being low WITHOUT ANYONE CHECKING. So `add` still installs 700, and the
# promotion to 550 happens only after a packet has actually reached the internet
# through this bridge. No proof, no promotion, and a route that was promoted and
# then stops working is demoted again by the next event that re-runs the check.
#
# The residual case is honest to state: a host that goes to sleep with the cable
# in leaves a promoted route pointing at nothing until the next lease event or
# profile run. uplink-fallback.sh is the backstop for the version of that which
# actually strands the board - wifi off, nothing to fall back to - and turns the
# radio back on at boot.
