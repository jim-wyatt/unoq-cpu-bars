# ---------------
# Every script here has to be safe to re-run: bootstrap.sh calls them in
# sequence, and a half-finished board gets the same sequence again rather than
# a different recovery path. "Idempotent" here means the second run makes no
# changes and says so, not that it merely survives.
#
# They also have to work from wherever the repo was cloned. The scripts used to
# name the checkout path and the `arduino` user literally, which is fine on the
# board they were written on and wrong everywhere else.

# --- who and where ---------------------------------------------------------

# The repo root, derived from this file rather than assumed.

# root and useless; SUDO_USER is the account that invoked us, which is the one
# that owns the checkout, holds the group memberships and gets the venv.

# -----------------------------

# and a board that has been provisioned, purged or reflashed may not. The only
# moment it is certain to be there is the beginning, which is not the moment
# anyone thinks to look for it. It is 634 KB. Taking the copy on the way past
# costs nothing and removes the single most annoying way to need a factory
