# install_unit rewrites every systemd unit in this project on its way into
# /etc/systemd/system, substituting the checkout path and the owning user.
#
# The failure it has to prevent is a unit that installs happily and then fails
# at boot with 203/EXEC - a status that names the unit but not the path it
# could not run, and reads the same as a permissions problem. Two ways to get
# there:
#
#   1. The path spelled some way sed does not know. `~/hybrid` and
#      `$HOME/hybrid` look equivalent to /home/arduino/hybrid and are not:
#      systemd expands neither, and passes them to execve() literally.
#
#   2. A path that is simply not there yet, because provisioning steps have an
#      order and the venv or the script has not been built.
#
# Both are cheap to catch at install time and expensive to diagnose at boot.
#
# These tests also killed a check that could never fire. install_unit briefly
# asserted "no placeholder remains after substitution", which sounds sensible
# and is impossible - sed replaces it wherever it appears. Test 6 is what is
# left of that: it pins the actual behaviour instead.
