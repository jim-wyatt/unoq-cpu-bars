# which is only right if you cloned to exactly that path. A `git clone` with no
# destination puts the checkout wherever the repository is named, and then
# zbuild, zflash, hpy and mcucon all point at a directory that does not exist,
# while everything else keeps working. 50-shell-env.sh already points ~/.bashrc
# at the real checkout; this makes the rest of the file agree with it.
#
# NO FALLBACK PATH. There used to be one - `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$HOME/<repo>/env.sh}`
# - and it quietly reintroduced the exact assumption the paragraph above says
# was removed: sourced from a shell that does not set BASH_SOURCE, it would
# guess a path, be wrong, and every helper would point somewhere that does not
# exist with nothing to say why. Refusing is the honest answer, because there
# is no way to work out where this file is without the shell's help.

# The three aliases below are double-quoted on purpose, so $UNOQ_PROJECT is

# SC2139 warns about, and it is the behaviour we want: the alias should keep
# pointing at the checkout it was sourced from even if $HOME or the working
# directory changes underneath it. Disabled per line, not per file, so a future
# alias that genuinely wants late expansion still gets flagged.

# bypassed the project's own locking and interleaved with whatever else had the
