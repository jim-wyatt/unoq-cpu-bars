# In client mode the leased address is the ONLY one a plugged-in computer can
# reach; 10.55.0.1 needs a static route on the host, and docker0 is a bridge
# whose daemon 20-dev-tools.sh disables. So the two addresses it offered were
# the unreachable one and the meaningless one.
#
# $2 is the operational state in `ip -br` output, and it is DOWN for docker0
