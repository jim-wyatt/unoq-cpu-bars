# Break the boot loop that a bad USB bind can put this board into.
#
#   bind-guard.sh check     # before binding: count the attempt, refuse after N
#   bind-guard.sh confirm   # once the board is demonstrably healthy: reset
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# usb.md's model is that plugging in is an occasional event: a UDC appears,
# udev fires, the gadget binds. That is true on a bench. It is not true of a
# board powered over the same USB-C cable that carries the gadget, which is the
# normal way this one is used - there, the cable is NEVER unplugged, so a UDC
# is present within seconds of every boot and the bind runs on every boot.
#
# That turns a survivable one-off failure into an unsurvivable repeating one.
# Binding re-enumerates the port. If the board is a sink at
# power_operation_mode=default - USB default current, no PD contract, which is
# what a laptop port gives you and is not much for four cores plus an MCU -
# re-enumerating under load can brown it out. It reboots, the UDC is still
# there, udev fires the bind, and it browns out again.
#
# The loop has no SSH window in it. Nothing to log into, wifi never finishes
# coming up, and the only way out is a factory restore. The cost of being
# wrong here is the whole board, which is what justifies a guard at all.
#
# HOW IT BREAKS THE LOOP
# ----------------------
# `check` increments a counter on disk and fails once it exceeds MAX, which
# stops the bind from running at all. `confirm` clears it, and is run by
# unoq-usb-confirm.service a couple of minutes into a boot that actually got
# as far as having a network. So:
#
#   healthy boot -> bind, counter 1, ... confirm clears it -> next boot starts at 0
#   brownout loop -> bind, counter 1, reset, 2, reset, 3, reset, 4 > MAX
#                    -> bind refuses -> board boots clean -> wifi -> ssh
#
# The board gives up the gadget and keeps the network, which is the right way
# round: the gadget is the thing being experimented with, the network is how
# you get in to fix it. If wifi has been turned off to save the power budget,
# refusing to bind also turns it back on - see wifi_rescue() below, because
# without that the "network" the guard is protecting does not exist.
#
# This is the same shape as the MCU's FOTA rollback - try the new thing, and
# fall back automatically if it does not confirm itself - applied to the half
# of the board that can also strand you.
#
# RECOVER by hand after the guard has tripped:
#
#   sudo rm -f /var/lib/unoq/usb-bind-attempts
#   sudo systemctl start unoq-usb-bind.service

# Turning the radio back on is the other half of refusing to bind.
#
# The reasoning above - give up the gadget, keep the network - holds only while
# there IS another network. Once wifi is off to save the power budget (wifi.sh),
# the gadget is the sole way in, and a guard that refuses to bind would take the
# board off the air entirely rather than rescue it: exactly the outage it exists
# to prevent, arrived at from the other direction.
#
# So the guard restores the thing that was given up. Wifi costs power, which is
# what the board is short of, but a board you can reach is worth more than a
# board that boots quietly forever, and this only ever runs on a board that has
# already failed to survive three boots.
#
# nmcli persists the radio state, so it stays on across the reboot too - which
# it must, because the next boot is the one you will be trying to log into.
# Disable with UNOQ_GUARD_WIFI_RESCUE=0 if the board genuinely has no wifi.

# State is "<boot_id> <count>", not a bare number, and the boot id is the part
# that makes the count mean BOOTS rather than invocations.
#
# The bind unit deliberately runs more than once per plug-in. udev triggers it
# when the UDC appears, and again for each gadget netdev - usb0 for ncm, usb1
# for rndis - because those only exist a moment after the bind. That is three
# runs on a perfectly healthy plug-in. Counting invocations would therefore
# have reached a limit of 3 during the first SUCCESSFUL plug-in and refused to
# bind ever again: a guard that causes exactly the outage it exists to prevent,
# and one that would have looked like the gadget being broken rather than the
# guard being wrong.
#
# So only the first check of any given boot counts. Later ones in the same boot
# are waved through, and the counter only advances when the board has come up
# again without ever having confirmed.
