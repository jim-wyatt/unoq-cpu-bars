"""Tests for the learning-content web server.

Unlike the rest of the suite these talk to a real socket - but only to
127.0.0.1 on an ephemeral port, so they need no hardware and no network. The
server is the one component here whose whole job is I/O; testing it against a
fake socket would be testing the fake.
