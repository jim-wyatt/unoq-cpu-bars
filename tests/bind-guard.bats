# usb/bind-guard.sh is the component with the worst failure mode in the
# project. It exists to stop a USB bind that browns the board out from becoming
# a permanent reboot loop - and if its own counting is wrong it causes exactly
# the outage it prevents, on a board that then cannot be reached over USB to
# fix it.
#
# That has already happened once. udev triggers the bind unit three times on a
# healthy plug-in (once for the UDC, once per gadget netdev), so an earlier
# version counting invocations reached its limit of 3 during the first
# SUCCESSFUL plug-in and refused to bind ever again.
#
# The fix - only the first check of any boot counts - is the thing these tests
# are here to hold in place.
