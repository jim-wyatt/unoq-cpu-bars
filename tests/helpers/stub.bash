# WHY THIS AND NOT A REFACTOR
# ---------------------------
# The obvious way to make shell testable is to split every script into a
# "decide" half and a "do" half, and test the first. That is a large change to
# scripts that currently work, made before there are any tests to catch it
# going wrong - which is the wrong order.
#
# These scripts already have a seam, because everything they actually do is
# another program: ip, nmcli, systemctl, logger, dnsmasq. Shadowing those on
# PATH lets the REAL script run, unmodified, while nothing reaches the board.
# What you assert on is the argv it would have used.
#
# The limit is worth stating: this proves what a script decides to run, not
# that running it has the intended effect on a kernel. `ip route replace` being
# called with the right arguments is not the same as the route existing. That
# second half is what the board is for.

# stub_setup - private bin at the front of PATH, and an empty call log.
# Call this in setup(), before running anything under test.
stub_setup() {
  STUB_DIR="$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR/stub-bin"
  STUB_LOG="$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR/stub-calls.log"
  mkdir -p "$STUB_DIR"
  : >"$STUB_LOG"
  PATH="$STUB_DIR:$PATH"
  export PATH STUB_LOG
}

# stub <name> [exit_code] [stdout]
#
# Records one line per invocation: the command name followed by its arguments,
# space separated. Arguments containing spaces are not distinguishable in the
# log, which is fine for everything here and worth knowing before you rely on
# it for something else.

# stub_body <name>  (body on stdin)
#
# A stub that still records every call, but then runs logic of your own. For
# commands a script uses in two different ways and expects different answers
# from - `ip link show` as a probe, then `ip route replace` as an action.
