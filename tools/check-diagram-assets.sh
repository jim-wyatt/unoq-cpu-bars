# Are the diagram assets wired up so that a browser with no network could draw?
#
#   tools/check-diagram-assets.sh [site-dir]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM check-diagrams.sh
# --------------------------------------------------
# check-diagrams.sh opens a real browser and is the only thing that can prove a
# diagram actually draws. It is also slow (~60s), needs chromium, and has now
# failed twice for reasons that had nothing to do with the diagrams - once
# hanging a CI job for fifteen minutes, once reporting "0 of 1 drew" on every
# page of a build that renders perfectly on this board.
#
# That is a bad gate to put in front of every pull request, and a worse one to
# be the ONLY thing guarding a constraint the whole site is designed around.
#
# So the invariants that can be checked without a browser are checked here, in
# about a tenth of a second, with no dependencies:
#
#   1. the mermaid library is VENDORED, not fetched                (offline)
#   2. nothing in the theme bundle points at an absolute CDN url   (offline)
#   3. mermaid-init.js shipped                                     (rendering)
#   4. every page with a diagram on it loads that script           (rendering)
#
# (1) and (2) are the USB-drive constraint from the top of mkdocs.yml: a laptop
# with no internet, opening the drive as file://. (3) and (4) are the bug that
# started all this - Material loads the library and never calls mermaid.run().
#
# What this canNOT catch is mermaid.run() throwing once it is called. That is
# what the browser gate is for, and why both exist.
