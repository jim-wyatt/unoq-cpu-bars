# Rebuild the OpenOCD that flashes this board's MCU, from source.
#
#   sudo bash ~/two-computers-one-board/tools/build-openocd.sh              # build + self-test
#   sudo bash ~/two-computers-one-board/tools/build-openocd.sh --promote    # ...and replace /opt/openocd
#
# WHY
# ---
# /opt/openocd is owned by no Debian package - `dpkg -S /opt/openocd` finds
# nothing. It was dropped in by an install script, so apt can never reinstall
# it, and it is the ONLY way to flash the STM32U585 (the MPU bit-bangs SWD via
# libgpiod; there is no external probe). That made it a single point of failure.
# This script removes that dependency.
#
# SOURCE
# ------
# Upstream openocd-org/openocd **master**, not a fork and not a release tag.
#
#   - libgpiod v2 (this board has libgpiod.so.3) is supported on master:
#     configure.ac does PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBGPIOD], [libgpiod >= 2.0]) and
#     linuxgpiod.c uses the v2 API, falling back to v1. Master is required -
#     the newest tag is still v0.12.0 (2023), which predates that support, so
#     `apt install openocd` (0.12.0) will NOT work.
#   - The STM32U5 flash driver (`stm32l4x`) is upstream.
#   - The three .cfg files are plain TCL kept in this repo, not in OpenOCD.
#
# The pinned commit is for reproducibility; override with OPENOCD_COMMIT, or
# set it to `master` to track the tip.
