# No sudo and no apt. Debian's shellcheck/shfmt would need root, and this board
# is often used by a non-root user, so those two come from upstream releases
# into ~/.local/bin instead.
#
# Python tooling goes into the project venv rather than a uv tool install,
# because mypy has to import gpiod, pyserial and smpclient to check the code
# that uses them.
#
# Arch is detected rather than assumed: the board is aarch64, but CI runs this
# same script on x86_64.

# Both of those were wrong, and the way they were wrong was invisible. A GitHub
# Actions runner ships shellcheck preinstalled, so `command -v shellcheck &&
# skip` meant CI silently linted with the runner's 0.9.0 while the board used
# 0.11.0 - and 0.9.0 enables SC2002 by default where 0.11.0 makes it optional.
# The result was a gate that passed locally and failed in CI with nothing to
# point at, which is exactly the thing check.sh's header promises does not
# happen. Chasing `latest` has the same problem in slow motion: the board
# installs once and CI re-resolves every run, so they drift apart on their own.
#
# Bump these deliberately, and both ends move together.
