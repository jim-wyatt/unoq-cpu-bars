# usb/usb-profile.sh is the fallback that runs when the host will not lease the
# board an address. It is the only thing in this project that assigns the board
# an address on somebody else's subnet without being asked, which makes it the
# one most able to break a network it was plugged into politely.
#
# So most of what is tested here is refusal: it must not claim an address that
# is taken, must not claim one on a host it has not positively identified, and
# must give back anything it took that did not turn out to route.
#
# The board this was written on is the case it exists for: ICS NAT-ing at
# 192.168.137.1 at 17ms, and answering no DHCP discover at all.
