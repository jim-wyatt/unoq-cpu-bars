#
# WHY IT IS WRITTEN TWICE
# -----------------------
# The board builds a standalone workspace at ~/zephyrproject, outside the
# checkout, because the Zephyr tree is 3.3 GB and should survive deleting the
# repository. CI cannot do that - the setup action needs the application repo to
# BE the manifest repo (`west init -l`), so it needs a west.yml here.
#
# Two topologies, two declarations of the same version, and no mechanism in west
# to share one. So: a gate instead of a convention. A CI job that compiles a
# different Zephyr from the board is worse than no CI job at all, because it
# reports green about something nobody is running.
#
# No network, instant, so it runs on every check.sh.

Zephyr version pinned in two places, and they disagree:

  provision/user/30-zephyr-workspace.sh   $prov   (what the board builds)
  west.yml                                $manifest   (what CI builds)

Change both. If you are upgrading Zephyr, docs/reference/mcu.md has the
procedure - the SDK version usually moves with it.
