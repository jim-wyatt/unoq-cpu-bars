MCU interface: the Zephyr shell over /dev/ttyHS1.

The shell is a line protocol - send a command, read until the prompt comes
back. SMP/MCUmgr frames share the same UART (the shell detects them in the byte
stream, so there is no `mcumgr` shell command), but that half lives in fota.py.

This wraps only the `app` command group the firmware defines. Everything else
the shell offers - `gpio`, `i2c`, `device`, `kernel`, `devmem` - is reachable
through cmd() or by typing it at `tio /dev/ttyHS1`, and needs no wrapper here.
