Host CPU load on the LED matrix - the whole hybrid loop in one command.

    unoq-cpu-bars                 # one bar per core, until Ctrl-C
    python -m unoq.cpubars --interval 0.25

The MPU samples /proc/stat (cpu.py), sends whole percentages over the serial
link (mcu.py), and the MCU rasterises them onto the panel from a timer ISR
(mcu/app/src/bars.c). Nothing here knows how a bar is drawn, and nothing on the
MCU knows what a core is.
