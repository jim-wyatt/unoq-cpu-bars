#
# ADDRESSING
# ----------
#   the board    asks the computer for an address by DHCP
#   if nobody    answers, IPv4 link-local instead - 169.254.x.y, RFC 3927
#   either way   the board answers to <hostname>.local over mDNS
#
# ONE DIRECTION, NOT TWO
# ----------------------
# The board is always the DHCP client here. It used to be switchable - a server
# mode where the board sat at a static 10.55.0.1 and ran dnsmasq to lease the
# computer an address, and a client mode for when the computer was the one
# sharing its internet. Both existed at once, the mode was a file in /etc, and
# 10.55.0.1 stayed on the bridge in both.
#
# That was two of everything: two DHCP daemons to keep from fighting over one
# wire, two sets of route and DNS handling, two answers to "what do I ssh to",
# and a second address on the bridge whose only job was to be there when the
# other one was not.
#
# Client-only is what makes a single address possible, because the two hosts we
# do not control are not negotiable. Windows Internet Connection Sharing pins
# its adapter to 192.168.137.1/24 and macOS Internet Sharing to 192.168.2.1,
# each runs its own DHCP server, and neither will ever take a lease from us. A
# board that wants internet over the cable has to accept their numbering. So it
# accepts it, and the fixed thing you type is a NAME rather than an address.
#
# WHEN NOBODY IS SERVING DHCP
# ---------------------------
# The cable is plugged into a computer that is not sharing anything, or ICS is
# off, or the host is still booting. This is the case the old static 10.55.0.1
# existed for, and link-local does the same job properly.
#
# Every desktop OS self-assigns 169.254.x.y when its own DHCP finds nothing, so
# a board doing the same lands on the same /16 as the computer automatically -
# no host configuration, no elevated `route add`, on Windows, macOS and Linux
# alike. That is the part 10.55.0.1 could never do: a board on a private /24 of
# its own needed a static route added by hand at the other end before anything
# could reach it.
#
# avahi is what turns that into something typeable. It publishes <hostname>.local
# on every interface, so the name resolves to whichever address this link ended
# up with - leased or link-local - and Windows 10+, macOS and Linux all resolve
# it with nothing installed.
#
# WHY A BRIDGE
# ------------
# Historically: the gadget offered two configurations, RNDIS and NCM, each with
# its own netdev on this side, and we could not know which the host would pick.
#
# That is no longer the reason - gadget-up.sh now builds one configuration with
# one network function. br-usb is kept because it is the interface name the
# units, uplink-fallback.sh, wifi.sh and every ssh instruction in the docs refer
# to, and because it survives the netdev disappearing on unplug where an address
# on usb0 would not. It is a stable name doing the work now, not a bridge.
#
# This deliberately does NOT set a default route or NAT. Routing is usb-route.sh's
# business, from a lease event, at a metric that loses to every real link.
