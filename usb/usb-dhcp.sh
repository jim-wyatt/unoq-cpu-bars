#
# WHY THE BOARD IS THE CLIENT
# ---------------------------
# Because the two hosts we do not control are not negotiable. Windows Internet
# Connection Sharing pins its shared adapter to 192.168.137.1/24 and runs its own
# DHCP server there; macOS Internet Sharing does the same at 192.168.2.1. Neither
# will ever ask us for a lease. A board that wants internet over the cable has to
# take the address, the gateway and the DNS servers from whatever the host is
# running, so that is what this does. Nothing here is hardcoded to Microsoft's
# numbering: the same code works for macOS, for a Linux host running its own
# dnsmasq, and for whatever ICS is changed to next.
#
# WHEN NOBODY IS SERVING - LINK-LOCAL
# -----------------------------------
# `leasefail` is not an error to log and forget. It is the cable plugged into a
# computer that is not sharing anything, and it used to be the case a static
# 10.55.0.1 on the bridge existed to cover.
#
# It is covered by IPv4 link-local instead, which is the same answer every
# desktop OS already reaches on its own: Windows, macOS and Linux all self-assign
# 169.254.x.y when their DHCP finds nothing. So both ends land on the same /16 by
# themselves, with no host configuration at all - where 10.55.0.1 needed a static
# route typed in at the other end, elevated, before anything could reach the
# board.
#
# avahi makes it typeable. <hostname>.local resolves to whichever address this
# link ended up with, leased or link-local, on all three OSes with nothing
# installed. That only works because there is now exactly ONE address on this
# bridge: avahi advertises every address an interface has, and the old pair meant
# two A records with the host free to pick the one it had no route to.
#
# So: link-local goes on when DHCP gives up, and comes off the moment a real
# lease arrives. Never both.
#
# AND BEFORE LINK-LOCAL, THE HOST PROFILE
# ---------------------------------------
# Link-local has one weakness, and it is the one that matters to somebody who
# plugged the cable in to get online: it has no gateway, and RFC 3927 forbids
# routing off-link through a 169.254 next hop. The board is reachable from that
# one computer and from nowhere else.
#
# There is a host that deserves better than that, and it is not rare - it is a
# Windows box whose ICS is NAT-ing perfectly while its DHCP half answers
# nothing. The gateway is up, it forwards, and the only thing missing is the
# address. usb-profile.sh recognises that host by ARP, takes an address on its
# subnet, and keeps it only if a packet actually reaches the internet.
#
# So the order on leasefail is: a recognised host that routes, else link-local.
# Still exactly one address on the bridge, whichever it is.

#
# Only when this link is actually carrying the board's traffic. NetworkManager
# owns /etc/resolv.conf on this image (dns=default, systemd-resolved is off), so
# writing it is taking something off NM - fine when the USB cable is the only
# uplink, and a regression if wifi is up, because unplugging the cable would
# then leave the board pointing at a nameserver it can no longer reach.
#
# "Actually carrying it" is decided by the routing table rather than by a flag,
# which makes it self-correcting: turn wifi off and the next renew takes DNS
# over, turn it back on and the next one hands it back. It is why wifi.sh kicks
# a renew rather than editing resolv.conf itself.
#
# This asks WHICH INTERFACE wins, rather than comparing our metric to a number.
# It used to do the latter - "is the best metric >= 700" - which was a correct
# reading of the routing table only while our route was always the worst one on
# it. usb-route.sh's `prefer` broke that assumption the day it was added: a
# promoted route is metric 550, the best default route on the board becomes
# 550, and `550 >= 700` is false - so the check would conclude the USB link was
# NOT carrying traffic at the exact moment it had just taken it over, and hand
# resolv.conf back to NetworkManager. Comparing devices cannot rot that way.

# A verified list of nameservers to write, given the ones this link offered.
#
# WHY THE LINK'S OWN NAMESERVER IS NOT TAKEN ON TRUST
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Because the host this whole fallback path exists for is a host with half its
# services working. Windows ICS NATs perfectly while answering no DHCP - that is
# what usb-profile.sh is for - and the same adapter answers no DNS on the
# gateway address either, since the DNS proxy is the other half of the service
# that is not running. A Linux host NAT-ing with plain nftables never had a
# resolver on that address to begin with.
#
# Pointing resolv.conf at that gateway anyway gives the worst-shaped failure in
# this file: traffic routes, `ping 8.8.8.8` works, and every name lookup hangs
# until it times out. "apt does not work but the network is fine" is a long
# afternoon, and it is indistinguishable at the terminal from the wifi-off
# symptom that wifi.sh's renew kick already exists to prevent.
#
# So the nameserver is asked a question before it is written down, and if it
# cannot answer, DNS goes to a public resolver over the link that has already
# been proved to carry traffic. Routing and resolving are separate capabilities
# and this is the one host that has one without the other.
#
# It ASSIGNS its answer - RESOLVERS for the list, DNS_NOTE for the reason - and
# logs nothing itself. Both are deliberate:
#
# An earlier version printed the list and was read through a command
# substitution, so the first log line it emitted went into resolv.conf as a
# nameserver. That is not a hypothetical either; it happened on the board this
# was written on, and produced a resolv.conf of eleven English words.
#
# Leaving the logging to the caller is what keeps the journal readable. This
# runs on every lease event, and on a host that serves no DHCP that is every 35
# seconds for as long as the cable is in. write_resolv says the reason when the
# file actually changes, which is when somebody would want to read it.
