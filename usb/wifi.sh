# Turn the board's wifi radio off, once the USB link can carry the traffic.
#
#   ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/wifi.sh status      # what is on, and what would be left
#   sudo ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/wifi.sh off    # checks the USB link first, then off
#   sudo ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/wifi.sh on     # back on, whatever state anything is in
#
# WHY
# ---
# As a device the board is a power sink, and a host port with no PD contract
# gives it USB default current - not much for four cores plus an MCU. The wifi
# radio is the largest thing on the board that can simply be switched off, and
# on a board that is plugged into a computer anyway, it is also the most
# redundant: the NCM link is already there and is faster.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `nmcli radio wifi off`
# -------------------------------------------
# Because that command, run at the wrong moment, is how you lose the board.
#
# You are almost certainly typing it over the wifi it is about to turn off. If
# the USB link is not carrying traffic - the gadget did not bind, the cable is
# charge-only, the host is not sharing its connection - then the moment the
# radio goes down there is no path to the board at all. Not slow: absent. The
# next step is a serial console or a factory restore.
#
# So `off` refuses unless it can see the link actually working, and says which
# check failed. --force skips the checks for when you know better (a serial
# console open, or you are not on wifi in the first place).
#
# WHAT `off` DOES BEYOND THE RADIO
# --------------------------------
# It kicks the DHCP client into renewing. NetworkManager owns /etc/resolv.conf
# on this image and rewrites it when the radio goes down, taking the board's
# nameservers with it; usb-dhcp.sh puts them back, but only on a lease event.
# Without the kick the board would route fine and resolve nothing until the
# lease next renewed, which on a Windows ICS lease is days away. That symptom -
# ping 8.8.8.8 works, apt does not - is a genuinely annoying one to chase.

#
# BOTH FAMILIES, because this used to ask only IPv4 and got the answer wrong in
# the exact case it exists for. With no DHCP server on the other end the board
# autoconfigures 169.254/16 and the host does too, but nothing makes the two
# ARP for each other until something sends v4 traffic - while IPv6 link-local
# comes up on its own and carries the ssh session. So the v4 table held one
# FAILED entry with no lladdr, the v6 table held the host REACHABLE, and this
# function reported "no computer on br-usb" to a person connected through it.
#
# v4 is still asked first: an address the host routes with is a better answer
# than one it merely answers on. Multicast is excluded because a neighbour that
# is not a host is not a way back in.

# Whether the computer on the other end is actually there.

# Not by ping alone: Windows blocks ICMP to its ICS adapter by default, so the

# and refusing on that basis would refuse in the normal case. The ping is worth
# trying because it succeeds outright on macOS and Linux hosts - and when it
# fails it has still forced ARP, which is the check that matters. A resolved
# neighbour means frames cross the wire and get answered, which is exactly the
# property "will I still be able to reach this board" depends on.
#
# The family is taken from the address rather than left to `ping` to guess,

# the interface the fe80:: address belongs to, and without it the ping fails on
