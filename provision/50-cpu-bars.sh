# IT KEEPS /dev/ttyHS1 OPEN. pyserial opens the port exclusively, so while this
# service runs, `mcucon`, `tio`, unoq.MCU and FOTA all fail with "device busy".
# Stop it before working on the MCU:
#
#     sudo systemctl stop unoq-cpu-bars      # start it again when you are done
#
# Flashing over SWD (flash.sh, zflash) is unaffected - that is OpenOCD on the
# GPIO lines, not the UART.
