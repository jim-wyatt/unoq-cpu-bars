# Glossary

Every term the course introduces, defined once, with a link to where it is
actually taught. Definitions here are deliberately short — the chapter is where
the idea gets explained, this is where you come to be reminded.

> [!TIP]
> Acronyms have hover definitions everywhere on this site. If you meet an
> unfamiliar one mid-sentence, point at it rather than coming here.

---

## A

**A/B slots**
:   Keeping two copies of a piece of software — one running, one being replaced —
    so that a failed update can be undone by switching a pointer back. Used by
    this board's bootloader partitions *and*, at a much smaller scale, by
    MCUboot for the firmware. See [From power to prompt](learn/from-power-to-prompt.md)
    and [Updating safely](learn/updating-safely.md).

**Admonition**
:   A callout box, like the tip above. Nothing to do with the board; mentioned
    because the documentation uses them for asides you can safely skip.

## B

**Baud rate**
:   How many signal changes per second a serial line carries. This board's
    MPU↔MCU link runs at 115200, which works out at roughly 9 ms for a
    104-byte message. See [How they talk](learn/how-they-talk.md).

**Binding (devicetree)**
:   A file that says which properties a kind of hardware may have and what they
    mean — the schema for a devicetree node. See
    [How the build knows your hardware](learn/how-the-build-knows-your-hardware.md).

**Binding (USB)**
:   Writing a USB controller's name into a gadget's `UDC` file, which is the
    moment the board actually appears on the host computer. See
    [One cable, many devices](learn/one-cable-many-devices.md).

**BOOT0**
:   A single wire, sampled by the microcontroller at reset, that selects between
    running your firmware and sitting in the chip's own ROM bootloader. Driven
    by Linux. Get it wrong and a perfectly good board looks dead — this is the
    single most expensive mistake available on this hardware.

**Bootloader**
:   A small program that runs before the real one, decides what to start, and
    starts it. This board has a chain of them on the Linux side and one
    (MCUboot) on the microcontroller.

## C

**Charlieplexing**
:   A wiring trick that drives *n* × (*n*−1) LEDs from *n* pins, by exploiting
    the fact that a microcontroller pin can be an input as well as high or low.
    Eleven pins, 104 LEDs. See [The LED matrix](learn/the-led-matrix.md).

**configfs**
:   A Linux filesystem where **creating a directory creates a kernel object**.
    Making a folder called `functions/ncm.usb0` does not make a folder; it makes
    a USB network function. See [One cable, many devices](learn/one-cable-many-devices.md).

**Confirmed image**
:   A firmware image that has told the bootloader it is working, so it survives
    the next reset. Until then it is on probation. LED 3 shows this: green
    confirmed, yellow not. See [Updating safely](learn/updating-safely.md).

**Coverage**
:   The fraction of lines and branches a test suite executes. It measures what
    ran, not whether the assertions were any good — see
    [Knowing it works](learn/knowing-it-works.md) for why it is enforced at 100%
    anyway.

**Cross-compiling**
:   Building on one kind of computer a program that will run on a different
    kind. Everything for the microcontroller is cross-compiled, on the Linux
    side of the same board. See [From source to a running chip](learn/from-source-to-chip.md).

## D

**Devicetree**
:   A description of what hardware exists and how it is wired, as data rather
    than code. Compiled into C macros at build time — there is no devicetree
    parser on the chip. See
    [How the build knows your hardware](learn/how-the-build-knows-your-hardware.md).

## F

**Firmware**
:   The program running on the microcontroller. The word is doing real work: it
    is the *only* program there, with no operating system beneath it in the
    sense Linux means.

**Framing**
:   Turning a stream of bytes into a sequence of messages. A wire delivers
    bytes when it feels like it, in any grouping; framing is the agreement that
    says where one message ends. See [How they talk](learn/how-they-talk.md).

## G

**Gadget (USB)**
:   A Linux-side definition of a USB device the board will pretend to be. Built
    from *functions* (a network adapter, a disk) grouped into *configurations*.
    See [One cable, many devices](learn/one-cable-many-devices.md).

**GPIO**
:   A pin software can read, or drive high or low. Five of them connect the two
    chips on this board.

## I

**Idempotent**
:   Doing it twice has the same effect as doing it once. The property that makes
    `bootstrap.sh` a recovery path rather than a one-shot. See
    [From factory to this](learn/from-factory-to-this.md).

**Interrupt**
:   Hardware stopping whatever the processor was doing to run a specific
    function immediately. The LED matrix refresh is one, firing every 10
    microseconds.

## J

**Jiffies**
:   The unit `/proc/stat` counts CPU time in. Not seconds — a tick whose length
    depends on the kernel's configuration, which is why the CPU percentages are
    computed from *differences* between two readings rather than from one. See
    [The Linux side](learn/the-linux-side.md).

## K

**Kconfig**
:   The system that decides which software features get compiled in. Distinct
    from devicetree, which describes what hardware exists — the two must agree,
    and most "device not ready" errors are them disagreeing. See
    [How the build knows your hardware](learn/how-the-build-knows-your-hardware.md).

## M

**MCU** (microcontroller unit)
:   The small chip. One core, 786 KB of memory, no operating system underneath
    you, and timing you can rely on. Here, an STM32U585.

**MCUboot**
:   The bootloader on the microcontroller. Keeps two firmware slots, boots the
    right one, and reverts an update that never confirms itself. See
    [Updating safely](learn/updating-safely.md).

**MPU** (microprocessor unit)
:   The big chip. Four 64-bit cores, gigabytes of memory, Debian Linux, and no
    timing guarantees whatsoever. Here, a Qualcomm QRB2210.

    (Confusingly, the same three letters also mean *memory protection unit* in
    Arm documentation. This course always means the processor.)

## N

**native_sim**
:   A Zephyr target that compiles firmware as an ordinary program for your
    laptop, so logic can be tested in seconds without a board. See
    [Knowing it works](learn/knowing-it-works.md).

**NCM / RNDIS**
:   Two USB standards for pretending to be a network adapter. NCM is the modern
    one and what the gadget is built with; RNDIS is Microsoft's older one, kept
    as a build-time alternative for a host with no NCM driver. Only one of them
    is ever offered — see [IP over USB](reference/usb.md).

## O

**Overlay**
:   A small devicetree file layered on top of the board's, so you can change
    what the board description says without forking it. This project's is 38
    lines.

## P

**Persistence of vision**
:   The reason a panel that lights one LED at a time looks like a steady
    picture. The matrix sweeps all 104 LEDs about a thousand times a second;
    your eye integrates. See [The LED matrix](learn/the-led-matrix.md).

**`/proc/stat`**
:   A file that is not a file. Reading it asks the kernel for CPU counters,
    formatted as text, generated at the moment you read. The source of every
    number this project's demo displays. See [The Linux side](learn/the-linux-side.md).

## R

**Rasteriser**
:   The code that turns "core 2 is at 47%" into which pixels are lit at what
    brightness. Pure arithmetic with no hardware in it, which is exactly why it
    can be tested on a laptop.

**Real-time**
:   Not "fast". Guaranteeing that something happens **by a deadline**. Linux is
    much faster than the microcontroller and cannot make that guarantee; the
    microcontroller is slow and can. This distinction is most of the argument
    for a board with both.

## S

**Sysfs**
:   Another filesystem that is not files — `/sys` exposes kernel objects as
    directories, which is how this project reads and writes the LEDs.

**systemd**
:   What starts and supervises everything on the Linux side. A *unit* is one
    thing it manages. See [The Linux side](learn/the-linux-side.md).

**SWD** (Serial Wire Debug)
:   Two wires that let one chip write flash on another, halt it, and read its
    registers. How firmware gets onto the microcontroller the first time.

## T

**Trigger (LED)**
:   A kernel feature that wires an LED to an event source — disk activity, wifi
    traffic — so it blinks without any program driving it. Three of them are
    registered on this board and none of them fire. See
    [Four lights that tell the truth](learn/four-lights.md).

## U

**UART**
:   The hardware behind a plain serial line: bytes, one bit at a time, on a pair
    of wires. On the Linux side it appears as the file `/dev/ttyHS1`.

**Unit (systemd)**
:   One thing systemd manages — a service, a mount, a timer. This project adds
    about half a dozen.

## W

**west**
:   Zephyr's meta-tool: manages the workspace, the several repositories in it,
    and wraps the build. See [From source to a running chip](learn/from-source-to-chip.md).

## Z

**Zephyr**
:   The real-time operating system running on the microcontroller. Small enough
    to fit in tens of kilobytes, and honest about being an operating system for
    one program rather than many. See
    [The microcontroller side](learn/the-microcontroller-side.md).

**ztest**
:   Zephyr's unit-testing framework. Runs on the chip, or on your laptop via
    `native_sim`.
