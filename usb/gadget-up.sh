# Build and bind the composite USB gadget: network + the fileshare drive.
#
#   sudo ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/gadget-up.sh          # build, and bind if a UDC exists
#   sudo ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/gadget-up.sh --build  # build only, never bind
#
# Idempotent: an existing gadget is left alone and re-bound if it came unbound.
#
# WHEN THIS RUNS
# --------------
# Not at a fixed point in boot. This board's dwc3 is `dr_mode = "otg"` and has
# no writable role switch - the Type-C controller decides host vs device from
# the CC lines when you plug a cable in. So a USB Device Controller only exists
# while the board is plugged into a computer, and this script is driven by a
# udev rule that fires when one appears. See usb/99-unoq-usb-gadget.rules.
#
# WHAT THE HOST SEES
# ------------------
#   config 1   network + UNO-Q drive   <- the only configuration there is
#
# ONE configuration, not two. An earlier version of this script put NCM in c.1
# and RNDIS in c.2 and let each host pick the one it supported. That cost us
# the drive on Windows completely, and took a long time to see, because the
# half that broke was not the half that was clever.
#
# Windows only treats a device as composite - and so only loads usbccgp.sys,
# which is the thing that gives each function its own driver - when all three
# of these hold:
#
#   - bDeviceClass is 0, or class/subclass/protocol are 0xEF/0x02/0x01
#   - the device has multiple interfaces
#   - the device has a SINGLE configuration
#
# Two configurations failed the third. No USB\COMPOSITE compatible id was
# generated, no generic parent driver loaded, and one driver bound to the whole
# device: networking worked, and the mass storage interface was never
# enumerated at all. Not hidden, not unmountable - absent. Windows offers one
# way out, an INF naming the configuration for usbccgp in the registry, which
# means shipping a signed driver package for a device whose ids belong to the
# Linux Foundation.
#
# So the network function is chosen here at BUILD time rather than by the host
# at enumeration time - UNOQ_GADGET_PRIMARY decides what goes in the single
# config. That trades host autodetection for a drive that actually appears.
