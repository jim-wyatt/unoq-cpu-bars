# usb/usb-route.sh is the lease hook usb-dhcp.sh calls. It runs as root, with an
# address that came off the wire, and it decides whether to move the board's
# DEFAULT ROUTE - which is the setting most able to break a machine remotely
# while leaving it looking fine.
#
# It has broken one already. The metric was 500, which BEAT NetworkManager's
# 600 for wifi, so plugging the board into a computer silently handed that
# computer the default route. SSH survived (a connected route on the LAN, not
# the default), so nothing looked wrong, while apt, git and every other
# outbound connection went to a host that was not NAT-ing.
#
# The metric test below is that bug, written down.

# opens with.
#
# The difference, and the only thing making it safe, is that it happens after a
# packet has reached the internet through the bridge. These tests are that
# condition. If promotion ever stops depending on the probe, the 500 bug is
# back with a different number on it.
