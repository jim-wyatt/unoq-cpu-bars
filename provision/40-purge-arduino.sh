# simply not true - apt removes packages, not files in $HOME. Measured after a
# real run of this script: ~/.arduino15 is still there, 621 MB of it, stock
# .hex included. Overstating the danger is its own kind of wrong, because the
# next person to read it learns to discount what this file says.
#
# What actually eats the image is a FACTORY RESTORE, which is also what puts it
# back. So the honest position is: the copy is cheap, take it early
# (bootstrap.sh does, in preflight), and refuse here if there is none - not
# because this script deletes it, but because this script is the point after
# which nobody thinks to look for it again.
#
# The image is FOUND, not guessed at. This used to glob
# .../hardware/zephyr/*/variants/*/*.hex, which matches nothing on core 0.55.2 -
# the .hex is in firmwares/, and variants/ holds the board's sources. So the
# backup silently found nothing, warned, and carried on into the purge, which
# is the failure this step exists to prevent, dressed up as having run.
#
# A find over the core covers both layouts and any later rearrangement, which
# matters because the layout is Arduino's to change and this script only gets
# one attempt at it, on someone else's board, with no way back.
