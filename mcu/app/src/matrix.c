 * Charlieplex driver for the UNO Q's 8x13 LED panel.
 *
 * The 104 LEDs hang off eleven pins, PF0..PF10, as ordered pairs: LED n is lit
 * by driving one pin high, one low, and leaving the other nine floating. Only
 * one LED is ever on; the illusion of a picture is entirely persistence of
 * vision, which is why the refresh runs from a timer ISR and not a thread.
 *
 * WHY REGISTER ACCESS, NOT THE GPIO API
 * -------------------------------------
 * Charlieplexing needs pins to change *direction*, not just level, once every
 * 10us. gpio_pin_configure_dt() is the API for that and it is far too heavy to
 * call 100k times a second - it re-resolves the port, takes a lock and walks
 * the pinctrl tables. Writing MODER and BSRR directly is a two-instruction
 * version of the same thing. The port is still claimed through the devicetree
 * (see matrix_init) so that Zephyr enables its clock and nothing else in the
 * build believes PF0..PF10 are free.
 *
 * The pin pairing and the 10us slot come from Arduino's own implementation for
 * this panel (ArduinoCore-zephyr, loader/matrix.inc) - it is the only
 * description of how this hardware is wired that exists. The grayscale is not
 * theirs: see the phase comment below.
