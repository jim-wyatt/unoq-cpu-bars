 * Render the ```mermaid fences. The library itself is NOT loaded by this file
 * and is not next to it: Material vendors mermaid (the `privacy` plugin turns
 * its CDN reference into a local copy under assets/external/) and emits its own
 * script tag for it. All this file supplies is the call that draws them.
 *
 * WHY NOT MATERIAL'S BUILT-IN INTEGRATION
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Material knows how to render mermaid, and it was doing so - but it fetches
 * the library itself, at a path baked into its shared JavaScript bundle, and
 * neither available form of that path works here:
 *
 *   site_url SET     the `privacy` plugin rewrites it to an ABSOLUTE url on the
 *                    public site, so every page with a diagram fetches the
 *                    library over the network. Dead on the USB drive.
 *   site_url UNSET   it comes out relative - and one bundle is shared by pages
 *                    at different depths, so `assets/external/...` resolves
 *                    correctly only from the site root. Every diagram in this
 *                    course lives under learn/ or reference/, where it 404s.
 *
 * Measured, not guessed: a headless Chromium render of learn/from-power-to-
 * prompt.html reported 0 blocks with `data-processed`, and
 * /learn/assets/external/... returned 404 while /assets/external/... returned
 * 200.
 *
 * `extra_javascript` does not have that problem: Material emits it as a script
 * tag per page, with the right number of ../ for that page's depth. So the
 * library is loaded here instead, and rendering is driven from here too.
 *
 * The one cost is that the file is a checked-in third-party blob (3.5 MB, MIT,
 * listed in docs/third-party.md) rather than something the build fetches. That
 * is the right trade: the whole point of these pages is that they work with no
 * network at all.
