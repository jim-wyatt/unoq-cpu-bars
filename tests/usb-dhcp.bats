# usb/usb-dhcp.sh is udhcpc's handler script. These tests cover two things it
# does.
#
# THE REMEMBERED ADDRESS in /var/lib/unoq/usb-dhcp-last, which is what
# `udhcpc --request` asks for at startup so the numeric address survives a
# reboot.
#
# The interesting case is the cable moving between a PC and a Mac. Windows ICS
# shares from 192.168.137.0/24 and macOS Internet Sharing from 192.168.2.0/24,
# and neither will lease an address out of the other's subnet - so the first
# request after a swap is refused. The running client recovers by itself, which
# is why this was easy to miss: the file is read ONCE, at startup, so a refusal
# left on disk is one the board repeats after every reboot until a lease
# happens to overwrite it.
#
# Three tests, because "a NAK deletes a file" is satisfiable by deleting the
# file at every opportunity. What makes it a behaviour is that `bound` writes
# it and `deconfig` - which runs on every stop and every start - leaves it
# alone.
#
# AND RESOLV.CONF, which is the other thing a lease hands over and the one that
# fails least visibly. The host that this link most often meets is a Windows box
# sharing its connection with half the stack running: it NATs, and it answers
# neither DHCP nor DNS. Writing its gateway down as the nameserver on that
# evidence produces a board that routes and cannot resolve - `ping 8.8.8.8`
# works, `apt` hangs - so the nameserver is asked a question first and DNS goes
# public when it cannot answer.
