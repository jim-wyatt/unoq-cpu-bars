# right moment to close that gap - it is the one point where a long download is
# expected anyway, and it happens before the Zephyr workspace fills the disk.

# mid-run would sit on /var/lib/dpkg/lock and this would fail on a board that
# is doing nothing wrong.

# a dependency. On a board whose Qualcomm platform packages are what make it
# bootable, "apt removed something to move forward" is not a trade worth taking
# for a newer library, and anything held back stays held back and visible.
#

# overlay ships modified configs, and confdef alone would let a maintainer's
# version win wherever the package has no explicit rule.

# whatever link you are connected over.

# with a Zephyr build, the safe default is the other way round.
