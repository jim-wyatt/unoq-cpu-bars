# usb/wifi.sh decides whether it is safe to turn off the radio you are probably
# connected over. Its preflight is the whole safety story, and the question it
# has to answer is narrow: is there a computer on the other end of the cable
# that will still be able to reach this board once wifi is gone?
#
# It got that wrong by asking only IPv4.
#
# With no DHCP server on the host, the board autoconfigures 169.254/16 and so
# does the host, but neither ARPs for the other until something sends v4
# traffic. IPv6 link-local needs no such prompting - it comes up by itself and
# is what actually carries the ssh session. So on a live board the v4 neighbour
# table held a single FAILED entry with no lladdr, the v6 table held the host
# REACHABLE, and `wifi.sh check` told a person connected through that very link
# that there was "no computer on br-usb".
#
# Failing safe is not the same as being right: the refusal made `off` unusable
# in precisely the configuration it was written for. These tests are that bug.
