# WHY
# ---
# Everything else this project does to stay reachable - the bind guard, the
# uplink fallback, the wifi rescue - reports through channels that need the
# board to be reachable. Logs need ssh. status.sh needs a shell. The one moment
# you want to know what state the board is in is the moment you cannot ask it.
#
# An LED needs nothing. It is the only diagnostic here that works across a room,
# on a board nobody has logged into.
#
# FOUR RGB LEDS, OF WHICH LINUX OWNS TWO
# --------------------------------------
# Linux exposes six writable entries under /sys/class/leds/unoq:*, and it is
# very tempting to read that as six indicators. It is not. They are the red,
# green and blue channels of TWO RGB packages, which the -1 and -2 suffixes are
# quietly telling you:
#
#   LED 1   unoq:user-red1    unoq:user-green1   unoq:user-blue1
#   LED 2   unoq:panic-red2   unoq:wlan-green2   unoq:bt-blue2
#
# This was got wrong first time, and the hardware said so immediately: an
# earlier version lit four channels to mean four separate things and the board
# showed two cyan LEDs. sysfs cannot tell you this - every channel has its own
# directory and its own brightness file whether it is one package or six. Only
# looking at the board tells you.
#
# LED 3 and LED 4 are wired to the STM32, not to Linux. Zephyr's board
# definition calls them led3_red/green/blue and led4_*. Nothing here can reach
# them; that is firmware territory.
#
# THE DISK-ACTIVITY TRIGGERS DO NOT WORK ON THIS KERNEL
# -----------------------------------------------------
# The obvious way to show eMMC activity is to hand a channel to the kernel:
# `mmc0`, `disk-activity` and `disk-write` are all offered in the trigger list,
# and the kernel knows about every transfer at a resolution no polling loop
# could match. It was tried first for exactly that reason.
#
# None of them fire. Measured, with 400 MB of O_DIRECT writes running and the
# brightness sampled 400 times: ON in **0** samples, for all three triggers. The
# board agrees - nothing visible happens. The triggers are registered, so they
# appear in the list and accept being selected; whatever should call into them
# does not, on this kernel.
#
# Being listed is not the same as being implemented, and a trigger you can
# select is not a trigger that fires. So disk activity is not shown here at all -
# it moved to LED 4, on the MCU, fed from /sys/block/mmcblk0/stat, which does
# move and can be checked.
#
# Relatedly, the MMC subsystem registers an `mmc0::` LED of its own. It is NOT
# one of the four: it lives under the MMC controller rather than the gpio-leds
# node, and nothing is physically wired to it on this board. That is why you
# will never see it blink either.
#
# WHY SAMPLING FOR THE REST
# -------------------------
# Hooking bind-guard.sh and wifi.sh would light the LEDs at the moment things
# change, and be wrong forever afterwards if anything changed underneath. A
# stale LED is worse than a dark one, because it is confidently wrong. Sampling
# is self-correcting: pull the cable and within one interval the colours tell
# the truth again, whatever caused it.

Two RGB LEDs, above the matrix, opposite the USB-C port. Linux drives these
two; LED 3 and LED 4 belong to the STM32.

LED 1 - can this board reach anything?  (one colour at a time)

  green    the internet is reachable
  blue     a computer is on the USB cable, but nothing beyond it
           (the host is not sharing its connection, or is not routing)
  red      no uplink at all - go and look

LED 2 - systemd's opinion of this board

  green    every unit is healthy, and the bind guard has not tripped
  red      SOMETHING NEEDS A HUMAN: a systemd unit has failed, or the bind
           guard has refused to bind the gadget. Everything else on this
           board recovers by itself; these do not.

Green is not decoration. A dark LED cannot tell you the difference between
"nothing is wrong" and "the thing that checks is not running", and those need
very different responses.

Sampled every ${INTERVAL}s, so the colours correct themselves rather than
remembering something that has stopped being true. Reachability is probed every
$((INTERVAL * NET_EVERY))s.

eMMC activity is deliberately NOT here. The kernel's mmc0, disk-activity and
disk-write triggers are all offered by this kernel and none of them fire -
measured at 0 of 400 samples under sustained writes. It lives on LED 4, driven
by the MCU.
