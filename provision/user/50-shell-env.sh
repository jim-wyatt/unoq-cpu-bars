# `shopt -s expand_aliases` is what makes this check able to pass at all.
#
# Bash only expands aliases in interactive shells. In a script - which is every
# way this ever runs - the alias builtin still records zbuild, but `command -v`
# will not report it, so the test failed on a perfectly good env.sh and told the
# reader to go and check it by hand. It had never once succeeded.
#
# It is worth being precise about why it looked fine when tested interactively:
# by then ~/.bashrc has already sourced env.sh, so zbuild is defined in the
# testing shell before the subshell below ever runs, and the check passes for a
# reason that has nothing to do with what it is checking.
#
# The three things asserted are one of each kind env.sh defines - an alias, a
# function, an export - because they fail independently: a syntax error early in
# the file leaves the later ones undefined, and the aliases in particular now
# depend on resolving the checkout path correctly.
