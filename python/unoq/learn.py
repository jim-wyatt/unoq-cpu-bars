Static web server for the on-board learning content.

    python -m unoq.learn --root ./share --port 9000

The board is often the only computer in the room with the material on it - it
is plugged into a laptop that may have no internet at all. So this serves from
disk, has no dependencies outside the standard library, and never fetches
anything: a page that needs a CDN is a page that is blank exactly when you
need it.

It is deliberately read-only and unauthenticated. It is reachable over the USB
link (and whatever else the board is on), so treat it as public to anyone who
can plug in a cable - do not put anything here you would not hand out.

    Purely informational - it is printed at startup so you can read the address
    off the console instead of guessing what the USB link came up as.

    LOOPBACK IS FILTERED, because the resolver has a documented way of handing
    back 127.0.0.2 that looks exactly like a real answer. nss-myhostname
    resolves the local hostname by asking the kernel over a netlink socket; if
    it cannot - no addresses configured, or the caller is sandboxed away from
    AF_NETLINK, which is what bit unoq-learn.service - it answers 127.0.0.2.

    A loopback URL is worse than no URL: it is the line someone reads to find
    out where to point a browser, and it looks like it worked. Filtering here
    is the belt to the unit's braces; neither alone is enough, because the unit
    fixes only this caller and the filter cannot invent an address.

    Resolving the hostname is kept deliberately. It is tempting to enumerate
    interfaces instead, but SIOCGIFADDR returns only an interface's PRIMARY
    address: on this board br-usb holds both 10.55.0.1 and the address the host
    leases over ICS, and that ioctl silently drops the leased one - which is
    the address a Windows user actually needs. getaddrinfo returns both.
