# Turn wifi back on if the USB link has not produced a route to the internet
# within a few minutes of boot. Run once per boot by unoq-uplink-fallback.service.
#
#   ~/two-computers-one-board/usb/uplink-fallback.sh          # the check, as the unit runs it
#   UNOQ_UPLINK_DEADLINE=60 ...              # shorter wait, for testing
#
# WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE BIND GUARD
# ----------------------------------------
# bind-guard.sh covers one failure: the bind itself is killing the board, so
# stop binding. It cannot see this one, because everything it checks succeeded.
# The gadget binds, br-usb comes up, the address is there - and the board still
# has no way out, because the computer at the other end is not sharing its
# connection, or is asleep, or woke up with the sharing switched off, or is a
# different computer than the one this board was set up against.
#
# With wifi on that is a nuisance. With wifi off - which is the whole point of
# wifi.sh, and the reason the power budget works at all - it is a board that
# boots, looks healthy, and cannot fetch anything, with no obvious culprit and
# no second path to go and look down.
#
# WHY A DEADLINE AFTER BOOT, RATHER THAN A WATCHDOG
# -------------------------------------------------
# A timer that polled forever would keep flipping the radio every time the host
# slept or the cable was jostled, and each flip is a NetworkManager reconnect
# and a resolv.conf rewrite. Worse, it would fight anyone who deliberately
# turned wifi off for a while.
#
# Boot is the moment the question is actually live: the board has just come up,
# something either works or it does not, and nobody is watching. So this asks
# once per boot, waits a few minutes for a host that may still be booting
# itself, and then either says nothing at all or turns the radio on and leaves
# it on. Falling back is a decision that stays made until a person unmakes it,
# which is the property you want from a fallback you are relying on.
#
# It does nothing whatsoever if wifi is already on - there is then nothing to
# fall back TO, and the check would only cost a few pings.
