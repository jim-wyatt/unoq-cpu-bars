# Runs the fast gates (lint, format, types, Python tests) but not the MCU
# suite, which builds Zephyr and takes ~70s - too slow to sit in front of

# the rest before you push.

# Skip once with:  git commit --no-verify

# A patch, not `git stash push --keep-index`. The stash records the file's
# whole change from HEAD, so popping it onto a working tree that has been reset
# to the index conflicts whenever a file is both staged AND further edited -
# which is exactly the case --keep-index exists to handle. Re-applying a diff
# of index->worktree onto a tree known to equal the index always applies.
#
# And restoring from a trap rather than inline after check.sh: the gates take
# long enough that people do interrupt them, and without this that left the
# working tree looking just like the staged version with the unstaged edits
# parked somewhere nobody had been told about.
