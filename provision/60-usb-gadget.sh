#
# Idempotent, and safe to run over SSH: it does NOT change the USB role. On
# this board it cannot - dwc3 is dr_mode="otg" with no writable role switch,
# and the Type-C controller picks host or device from the CC lines. Installing
# this only arranges for a gadget to be bound IF a USB Device Controller shows
# up, which happens when you plug the USB-C port into a computer.
#
# WHAT YOU GET, once plugged into a computer
# ------------------------------------------
#   the board      reachable as <hostname>.local, over mDNS
#   its address    leased by the computer, or link-local if nothing serves DHCP
#   a USB drive    "UNO-Q", read-only, with the VS Code installers on it
#   the web page   http://<hostname>.local:8080/
#
# The board is always the DHCP client on this link. Windows Internet Connection
# Sharing and macOS Internet Sharing both pin their own address and run their
# own DHCP server, and neither will take a lease from us - so a board that wants
# internet over the cable has to accept their numbering. The fixed thing you
# type is the NAME, not an address. See usb/usb-net-up.sh.
#
# WHAT YOU GIVE UP
# ----------------
# The USB-C port is the board's only USB data port. While it is a device, it
# is not a host: anything plugged into a hub or dock on it - network dongles,
# storage, keyboards - is gone until you unplug from the computer.

summary
cat <<EOF

Plug the board's USB-C port into your computer, then on the computer:

  ssh $TARGET_USER@$(hostname).local
  http://$(hostname).local:8080/    learning content + installers
  the "UNO-Q" drive                 same files, no network needed

The name is the address here. The board takes whatever address the computer
leases it - Windows and macOS both insist on their own numbering when they
share a connection - and falls back to link-local if nothing is serving DHCP
at all. mDNS is what makes that a single thing you can type: Windows 10+,
macOS and Linux all resolve it with nothing installed.

If you would rather have the number, ask the board:  usb/status.sh
