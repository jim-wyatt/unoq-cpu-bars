"""
The two MPU GPIO lines the MCU depends on.

These are NOT in the Zephyr board definition and are not documented by Arduino.
They were driven by `arduino-router`; with that service disabled, a board with
perfectly good firmware looks dead. See ~/hybrid/README.md.

    line 37  MCU BOOT0        latched at MCU reset. High/floating -> the STM32
                              boots its ROM bootloader (PC ~0x0bf9xxxx) and the
                              image in flash never runs, despite verifying OK.

    line 70  UART link enable low/floating -> the MCU transmits (LPUART1 CR1
                              shows TE set, ISR shows TC) but /dev/ttyHS1 reads
                              zero bytes.
