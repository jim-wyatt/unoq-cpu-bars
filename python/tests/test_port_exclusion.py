"""The port-exclusion path: who gets /dev/ttyHS1, and what you are told if not.

Nothing here opens a real tty. `open_port` is a thin wrapper over
`serial.Serial` plus one ioctl, so the interesting behaviour is entirely in
which exception comes out and what it says - and that is exactly the part that
has never been covered.

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
---------------------
The port had a comment promising kernel-enforced exclusion (TIOCEXCL) sitting
above a call that only took an advisory flock. The promise was wrong for as
long as it had been written, and no test could have noticed, because no test
ever exercised a failed open. These do.
