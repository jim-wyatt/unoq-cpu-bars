It is Arduino's image, so this repository does not ship it - but it is not
lost, either. It ships in the arduino-* Debian packages, so every board that
has not been purged still has a copy:

  mkdir -p ~/uno-q-backup
  find ~/.arduino15 -name '*stm32u585xx*.hex' -exec cp {} ~/uno-q-backup/ \;

A find rather than a path, because the layout has moved: on core 0.55.2 the
image is in firmwares/, not the variants/ directory this used to name.

bootstrap.sh takes that copy during preflight, and 40-purge-arduino.sh refuses
to run without one. If you have neither - purged an older checkout, or lost the
backup - a factory restore puts the packages back, and with them the image.
That is the only way back, and it is worth knowing it EXISTS: the copy is
recoverable, the board is not stuck.

then re-run this, or set STOCK_FW=/path/to/image.hex
